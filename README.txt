The .oxt files in this repository are Open Office extension files that
provide spell checking and hyphenation dictionaries compatible with
the hunspell library used in the viewer.  The canonical repository for
the .oxt files is at: 
  http://extensions.services.openoffice.org/en/dictionaries

They have been manually downloaded here so that they can be easily
packaged into the viewer installer.  Before adding any additional
dictionaries, ensure that the licenses are compatible with inclusion
in the Linden Lab (commercial) viewer.

TODO: add a URL to a wiki page on how to download and install dictionaries.
